With women like Julia I dream about fucking her. I would have totally asked her out by now if I wasn’t in a relationship. Besides I’ve had so many fantasies about fucking her. After she went on her cleanse last year she was so skinny and her hips were basically touching the counter and I wanted them to be riding me. I thought about her so many times. I’ve never had such strong thoughts about anyone. She tortures me overtime I see her and its gotten to the point I can barely look at her. I love that she never gets excited about anything. Nothing is a big deal. Occasionally she brings around this loser of a guy which I always pretend isn’t her boyfriend although it really feels like it is. He apparently doesn’t have shoes to wear in the snow even though it snows half the year here. And so he put plastic bags on his feet. What a worthless sack he is. What could he possibly do for her. He probably just listens to her talk and tell her she’s great, cause she is.
