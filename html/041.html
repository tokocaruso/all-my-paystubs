But then you turned to go.
You looked at me pity in your eyes and said, 
I can’t give you anymore of my time
I can’t have you on my mind, anymore
I can’t give you my time.
I won’t I won’t
Months have passed I’m finding my way. 
Not quite living, but I’m breathing okay
Except for the occasional sigh,
as deep as my bones
Can’t quite get used to this waking dream I’m half-living alone
The hard part is is, I know you love me.
In so much as you can love anyone. 
But thats not your fault…
I just don’t get it.
I was so patient with you.
Teaching you how to love. How to feel safe.
Until you turned on me.
Like a once loyal dog, gone rabid,
drowning in pain, frothing at the math, lashing out in madness.
Uncontrollably self-destruction.
and since I am just, you,
You destroyed me too.
any more of your time?
what does that even mean?
Don’t you see, it’s me
Who can save you from the traps in your mind.
I’m tired of being sad.
I wish I wanted to forget you.
sometimes I eve wish I hated you.
But I don’t. I won’t. 
Destined, forever 
to love the lost one
