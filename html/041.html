But then you turned to go.<br>
You looked at me pity in your eyes and said, <br>
I can’t give you anymore of my time<br>
I can’t have you on my mind, anymore<br>
I can’t give you my time.<br>
I won’t I won’t<br>
Months have passed I’m finding my way. <br>
Not quite living, but I’m breathing okay<br>
Except for the occasional sigh,<br>
as deep as my bones<br>
Can’t quite get used to this waking dream I’m half-living alone<br>
The hard part is is, I know you love me.<br>
In so much as you can love anyone. <br>
But thats not your fault…<br>
I just don’t get it.<br>
I was so patient with you.<br>
Teaching you how to love. How to feel safe.<br>
Until you turned on me.<br>
Like a once loyal dog, gone rabid,<br>
drowning in pain, frothing at the math, lashing out in madness.<br>
Uncontrollably self-destruction.<br>
and since I am just, you,<br>
You destroyed me too.<br>
Any more of your time?<br>
What does that even mean?<br>
Don’t you see, it’s me<br>
Who can save you from the traps in your mind.<br>
I’m tired of being sad.<br>
I wish I wanted to forget you.<br>
Sometimes I even wish I hated you.<br>
But I don’t. I won’t. <br>
Destined, forever <br>
to love the lost one<br>
