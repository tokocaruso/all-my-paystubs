You know I was dating this girl but I had to break up with her after 3 months.
Why? What happened?
Earwax…
I’ve dated some people with bad earwax like they had never before used a Q-tip.
Yeah, it wasn’t that exactly she was an “artist”  she collected her earwax and carved them into little figures, solidified them and then tucked them into necklaces.
