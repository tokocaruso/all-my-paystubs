The Hasidic woman sat down next to me waiting at the Broadway stop and immediately pulled out her prayer book and I thought she was feeling anxious because I had a fresh blue dye in my hair. Then I pulled out my journal because I realized she was the one making me feel anxious. It is really the hair thing that gets to me. Shaving off their hair and having to wear fake holy hair. That gets to me.
