I guess when I started accidentally dating her the same thing happened that time she saw me at the bar with the new girl I was dating<br>
    and dragged me outside to yell at me.<br> I acted like I had no idea what was going on.<br>
    She said I really like you Lili. I like hanging out with you. You always made me smile. You are why I told my parents I was gay.<br>
    You told them you were gay?!? How do you even know weâ€™ve never even kissed?
Barely hugged?
