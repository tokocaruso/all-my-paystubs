You have to know how to vacuum your own house and what I mean is that you should know which outlet to plug into and when you get to that certain point in the rug you should already know your next outlet move. If you do it often enough the outlet will be worn and loose as if it as been used weekly for years and years. Some people don’t know that. Can you imagine the next generation will be entitled and self-involved because their mothers brought them to vegan cafes and let them pick out whatever pastry they wanted. If they were too young to talk they just pointed and when the whining stopped that’s when you knew that was the doughnut they wanted. Does almond milk build strong bones?
