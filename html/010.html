He tells me that at the post office they used to have vending machines for stamps and they no longer do.<br>
    He asked the supervisor why there was no longer vending machines for stamps and he said the contract was up and they were stealing peoples money so they got rid of them. 
    <br>
    I wasn’t counting perfectly but I think he told me the same story like 5 times.<br>
    As long as I kept listening he would repeat the same thing.<br>
    It has happened before with the fried rice and the two Chinese restaurants across the street in the Hasidic neighborhood,<br>
    one had pork fried rice and the other one didn’t. Over and over he would tell me this.
