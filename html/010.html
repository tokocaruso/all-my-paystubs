He tells me that at the post office they used to have vending machines for stamps and they no longer do. He asked the supervisor why there was no longer vending machines for stamps and he said the contract was up and they were stealing peoples money so they got rid of them. I wasn’t counting perfectly but I think he told me the same story like 5 times. As long as I kept listening the same thing would heaven repeated over and over. The same thing has happened with the fried rice and the two Chinese restaurants across the street one had pork fried rice and the other one didn’t.
