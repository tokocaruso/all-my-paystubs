Did you know you can have a disorder based on factors such as your appearance?<br> odd or eccentric<br> I also learned that jealous is a subtype of a mental disorder. I always knew that to be one. Thinking your partner is full of infidelity can’t be good. The partners that live together are dependent upon one another. They must know everything about one another. Down to the last intimate detail so that they lose all mysteriousness and all sexual appeal is long gone after the dismissal of the invisible bathroom door. Let’s think about his and hers bathroom sinks. Who thought this was a good idea? Someone who wanted to constantly be sharing bathroom time. Thats who. Nothing sexually alluring happens in the bathroom and personally I think it ought to be done alone. Rule #883
