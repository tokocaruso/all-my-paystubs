The dancer I met invited me to the garden.<br>
    We met when the flowers were in full bloom.<br>
    You’re weird.<br>
    Go to some MFA program in Iowa if you want to write a book.<br>
    Even if it doesn’t work out for the best, get a story out of it. <br>
    Note to self* <br>
    You can not be stopped on the street any longer.<br>
    Oh because you have blue hair.<br>
    Good for fucking you. Write a poem about it. <br>
    What about that girl who convinced her boyfriend to commit suicide?<br>
    Do you think she’s a murderer?<br>
    The guy who rode the Greyhound bus and recorded it on film.<br>
    He writes 3 pages, uninterrupted in the morning before checking the news or email. <br>
    That is dedication to the craft or some sort of psychosis. <br>
    Do you really want to spend you money on cigarettes and trinkets?<br>
    Maybe we should go on a trip. <br>
    When you leave New York you leave most everything behind.<br>
    Even your stress.<br>
    What are you doing here and why did you come? 
    <br>To be…<br> An artist doesn't want to be anonymous. <br>
    They want their work to be known.
