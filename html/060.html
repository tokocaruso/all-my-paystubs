The dancer I met invited me to the garden. We met when the flowers were in full bloom but no longer true. You’re weird. Go to some MFA program in Iowa if you want to write a book. Are those people even from Iowa or are they must from somewhere else but need a calm, serene place to write. Even if it doesn’t work out for the best, you win get a story out of it. You can not be stopped on the street any longer. Oh because you have blue hair. Good for fucking you. Write a poem about it. What about that girl who convinced her boyfriend to commit suicide? Do you think she’s a murderer? The guy who rode the greyhound bus and recorded it took pictures and film. He writes 3 pages, uninterrupted in the morning before checking the news or email. that is dedication to the craft either that or some sort of psychosis. Do you really want to spend you money on cigarettes and trinkets. Maybe we should go on a trip. When you leave New York you leave most everything behind. Even your stress. What are you doing here and why did you come? To be… to create a business for yourself. An artist doesn't want to be anonymous. They want their work to be known.
