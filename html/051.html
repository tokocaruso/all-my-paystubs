They didn’t call me when gay marriage became legalized? Is that something to notice? I try to think of back then.. back before it got complicated if I ever wanted to sleep with her. I honestly don’t think I did. I thought about it, but I think about it with almost everyone so it doesn’t really matter. If anything I thought about seducing her and going down on her. Like I would anyone I had a crush on. She always kissed me on the lips. Friendly? I'm not sure? Teasing? Probably...
