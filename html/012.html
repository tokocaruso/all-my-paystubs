The radiators clanked, interrupting Craig from his dreamless sleep. His imagination was active enough during the day to entertain. His sleep was when the mind reset. He didn’t need to open his eyes to know Jay lie next to him. His back peacefully rising and falling, his slow sleeping rhythms Craig had memorized for a year now. The shadows above his eyes told him it was barely 5am. That and the damn radiator. The thing had scared him at first, forcing him to sleep on the couch. He thought rats may be playing catch with the carcasses of cockroaches inside the pipes. Jay told him was just a New York thing. He believed him as he believed everything his rosy lips said. He rest his hand on Jay’s hip and tried to fall back asleep. The radiators did not. Jay loved to sleep in, he was one of those adults who could sleep till 4pm if nobody woke him. This fact bothered Craig. He was known for his obsession with sunrise. It was not uncommon for him to wake at the monochrome time. The disillusion he felt at those early mornings, not knowing if the day was coming or going, he never felt tired. It inspired his poems, it make him a better lover, he believed so strongly in these facts. Jay’s sleep was not his fault. His mother’s depression showed him this pattern of rest was a normalcy. He would pry her skin from the sheets to take him to school. No chance he rid the behavior. Besides, to Craig it was his only flaw. Truly. He could not wait for Jay to wake. His hand moved his heavy dark bangs back from his forehead and he kissed Jay awake. Jay rolled the other way letting a soft moan float from the bed. Craig moved his hand along his back. He moved closer to him ensuring his arm could reach around to Jay’s waist. He stroked his hip and inner thighs grazing softly on his lovers warmth.
