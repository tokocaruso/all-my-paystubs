Remember that one day you forgot your PIN remember when you forgot your pen?
When your cousin got in a car crash but came out with a scratch
when you ex makes ‘headlines’?
when you read every book in the public library?
when you go see a stranger to hold scissors near your head for over an hours<br>
stories of a paranoid person when you feel rude passing people on the street
when you have an inner fight with yourself about whether to tell a stranger that there fly is down or there is something in there teeth
when you get arrested for making eye contact?
