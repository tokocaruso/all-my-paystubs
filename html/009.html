 I had a dream I was in a cab and he was giving me a ride and said it was free but then he got into the backseat and whipped out his dick and told me to suck it and I said no. He locked the door and he pulled his pants down and shoved three of his meaty Dominican fingers inside of me. He opened the window a little bit so I could potentially yell to the people passing by but I can never yell in my dreams when I’m in danger and I open my mouth to scream and it is as if my voice box is removed. Not even a faint noise comes from my gaping mouth. I close it quickly as if to not give him any ideas. Instead I see a couple walking their dog I try to smash the window but its is like I am locked in a soundproof room or trying to talk to the MTA booth attendant but really no one can hear me. In some instant, a weird one for me. I decide to stop fighting I give in to his urgent shoves, I try to enjoy myself, I reason I haven’t had sex in a week or two so maybe this will count. We are parked on a dead end facing north. It ways Grand Street but I know its not. I black out the next scene I am crawling out of the cab, running but not seeing the curb and smashing my palms into the gravel that meets the sidewalk I get up to start running again because he is now running after me. My torso is moving to fast for my legs and I toppled over myself again. Now I’m in a Russian Jewish neighborhood. There is a small woman outside she is just leaving her house walking the short steps and closing the gate behind her. I say to her help, he’s chasing me. It’s remarkable how fast she grabbed my arm spun around and pulled me inside. She brought me to a small door on the left side of the living room. It led to steps up into an elevated space, above the ceiling. It was carpeted
