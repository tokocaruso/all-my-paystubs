our optimism precedes us we are not always fine,<br>
okay<br>
sometimes when its raining and really dark <br>
	   car tires plow through puddles and I wish it was me<br>
other girls try to kiss me <br>
in my dreams<br>
I let them<br>
how wonderfully new infidelity in the mind can be when only scribbles on the page<br>
be careful get a job <br>
be polite<br>
I'm tired! I haven’t slept in days. <br>
	   Your young you can’t be tired. You're right when I'm old like you will I always be right?<br>
die sooner, live longer, run faster <br>
away<br>
with nowhere to go, but forward straight<br>
she’s not <br>
she sent me pictures of her menstruating breasts in the mail<br>
4x6 folded in a journal somewhere hundreds of them, in a shoebox next to unwrapped pill bottles that still have shroom residue in them <br>
you’ll never work for the  DEA<br><br>
	   
	   the other one is crying right now <br>
	   you thought about offering your shoulder <br>
if she didn’t live off two trains<br>
3 Avenues<br>
and five floors no elevator<br>
besides you don’t care enough<br>
	   so you thought about something else<br>
because your infidelity, your insecurity, your inexperience, your inadequacy with yourself<br>
	   with thoughts about the blue eyed girl.
the one who reminded you of your first not the first love, the first unloved<br>
you figure try it again she is nice and makes jokes and stays awake past midnight, baking<br>
