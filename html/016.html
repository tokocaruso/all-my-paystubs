Friends come and go Sam hasn’t talked to me in 2 weeks. It appears she needs her space. The thing she said was: I get the hint if you aren’t going to talk to me about your relationship I’m not going to talk to you about mine. What is your ideology about this. I didn’t know you had a cat. Isn’t that an important fact about someone. I don’t understand the concept of “keeping in touch”.
